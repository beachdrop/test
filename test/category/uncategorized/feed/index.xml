										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they&#8217;ve obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.</p>
<p>Oh, he says it&#8217;s nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old data.</p>
<p>Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There&#8217;ll be no one to stop us this time! No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can&#8217;t possibly</p>
<p>I call it luck. As you wish. Ye-ha! I can&#8217;t get involved! I&#8217;ve got work to do! It&#8217;s not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there&#8217;s nothing I can do about it right now. It&#8217;s such a long way from here. I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan</p>

<p>Kid, I&#8217;ve flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of strange stuff, but I&#8217;ve never seen anything to make me believe there&#8217;s one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There&#8217;s no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.</p>

<p>She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There&#8217;ll be no one to stop us this time! I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</p>
<p>Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you&#8217;re going. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.</p>

<p>Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion. What do you mean? I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station. Set your course for Princess Leia&#8217;s home planet of Alderaan. With pleasure.</p>

<p>The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi. If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally. Yes. Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it be done? He will join us or die, my master.</p>
<p>Itaque earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus. Cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia. Accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo.</p>
<p>I want to come with you to Alderaan. There&#8217;s nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. I&#8217;m trying not to, kid.</p>
<p>The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. You&#8217;re all clear, kid. Let&#8217;s blow this thing and go home!</p>
