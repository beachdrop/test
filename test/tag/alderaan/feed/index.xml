										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they&#8217;ve obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.</p>
<p>Oh, he says it&#8217;s nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old data.</p>
<p>Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There&#8217;ll be no one to stop us this time! No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can&#8217;t possibly</p>
<p>I call it luck. As you wish. Ye-ha! I can&#8217;t get involved! I&#8217;ve got work to do! It&#8217;s not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there&#8217;s nothing I can do about it right now. It&#8217;s such a long way from here. I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan</p>

<p>Kid, I&#8217;ve flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of strange stuff, but I&#8217;ve never seen anything to make me believe there&#8217;s one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There&#8217;s no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.</p>

<p>Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There&#8217;ll be no one to stop us this time! What!? Alderaan? I&#8217;m not going to Alderaan. I&#8217;ve got to go home. It&#8217;s late, I&#8217;m in for it as it is.

<p>There&#8217;s no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It&#8217;s all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. Red Five standing by. Red Five standing by.</p>
<p>Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it. That&#8217;s right. Well, don&#8217;t get all mushy on me. So long, Princess. Han! Yes, Your Highnessness? I thought you decided to stay.</p>

<p>He is here. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Red Five standing by. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. I&#8217;m surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.</p>
<p>Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I&#8217;m getting too old for this sort of thing. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I&#8217;m getting too old for this sort of thing.</p>

<p>She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There&#8217;ll be no one to stop us this time! I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</p>
<p>Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you&#8217;re going. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.</p>

<p>Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion. What do you mean? I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station. Set your course for Princess Leia&#8217;s home planet of Alderaan. With pleasure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can&#8217;t possibly&#8230;</p>

<p>At vero eos et accusamus. At vero eos et accusamus. Itaque earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus. Ut enim ad minima veniam, quis nostrum exercitationem ullam corporis suscipit laboriosam.</p>
