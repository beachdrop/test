<p>She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There&#8217;ll be no one to stop us this time! I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</p>
<p>Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you&#8217;re going. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.</p>
<p>Itaque earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus. Cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia. Accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo.</p>
<p>Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion. What do you mean? I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station. Set your course for Princess Leia&#8217;s home planet of Alderaan. With pleasure.</p>

<p>He is here. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Red Five standing by. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. I&#8217;m surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.</p>
